# PHPMVC

This is a MVC based framework for PHP. 

I orgnially started it based off this tutorial:  http://anantgarg.com/2009/03/13/write-your-own-php-mvc-framework-part-1/
but it did not have all the features and flexibility that I wanted.   I have updated the framework to bring it some of the concepts from .NET MVC site that I had been working on.   

I have gotten this framework to work on both LAMP installations as well as WIMP (Windows, IIS, MySql, PHP).  For the WIMP setup use the web.config files.   For Apache use the .htaccess files.
